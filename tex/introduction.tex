This document is a proposal for my Final Year Project, for which I will be implementing a SQRL client as an Android smartphone application. SQRL is a complete replacement for antiquated usernames and passwords, instead, using asymmetric public-key private-key cryptography and QR codes, to achieve the same authentication goals in a more convenient and secure manner. Exhaustive documentation of the protocol, user experience and all other aspects of SQRL can be found at \url{https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm}.
