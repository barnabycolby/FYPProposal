This document is a proposal for my Final Year Project, for which I will be implementing the SQRL protocol, consisting of a server side website and a client side smartphone app. SQRL is a complete replacement for antiquated usernames and passwords, instead, using asymmetric public-key private-key cryptography to achieve the same authentication goals in a more secure manner. Exhaustive documentation of the protocol, user experience and all other aspects of SQRL can be found at https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm.
