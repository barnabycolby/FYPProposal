The actual work that will be undertaken is described below. It includes several fallback positions to account for under-estimation of work, as well as several extra tasks to account for over-estimation. Each section builds upon the last, for example, the second fallback position includes all of the work described in the first fallback position. The core section describes the work that I expect to complete within the given time frame.
