If time permits, then I will tackle the implementation of a server-side website. This will involve basic SQRL authentication, QR code generation, support for the identity lock mechanism and possibly a username and password based fallback mechanism, as this is likely the adoption strategy that will be implemented by 3rd parties. It would also be desirable to create a server-side library to ease the implementation for others and accelerate adoption rates.
