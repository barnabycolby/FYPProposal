The first fallback position will involve completing a primitive version of an android smartphone SQRL client application. It should have the ability to scan a QR code using the camera and authenticate the user to a web server supporting the SQRL protocol. It should also be able to generate a master identity key for the user of sufficiently high quality randomness. This will involve writing a custom entropy harvester to ensure this is as strong as it could possibly be.
