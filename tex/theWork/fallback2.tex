The second fallback position adds password protection to the application to protect the scenario in which the smartphone itself is compromised, either physically or virtually. The application will be required to encrypt the master identity key with the password, as well as allowing the user to enter only the first four characters once the full password has been entered correctly for the first time, this is known as a password hint. Further security precautions will be added at this stage including successive chaining of SCrypt and use of the TPM chip inside the smartphone.
