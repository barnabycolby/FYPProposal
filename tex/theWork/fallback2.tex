The second fallback position adds password protection to the application to protect the scenario in which the smartphone itself is physically compromised. The application will be required to encrypt the master identity key with the password, as well as allowing the user to enter only the first four characters after entering the full password correctly for the first time. Also added to this stage will be secure storage of the users key, including AES-GCM encryption, successive chaining of SCrypt and use of the TPM chip inside the smartphone.
