The core of the work will be to write the SQRL client, which will be implemented as an Android smartphone app. Whilst the server-side is equally as important as the client side application, the client-side application involves a greater deal of cryptography and is a larger amount of work. At it's core, SQRL is a trivial protocol that results in some surprisingly powerful features, however, the real complexity is generated by the implementation of the identity lock mechanisms that provide recovery mechanisms when the master identity or password is compromised.
