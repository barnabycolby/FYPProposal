The core work of the project will be to write a complete SQRL client application. This includes the identity lock mechanism, allowing identity recovery in the scenario that the users master identity key is compromised. This protocol adds significant complexity to the application. Also added to this stage is the ability to import and export master identity keys, to allow use of a single identity across multiple devices.
